git init - When you run git init, a folder called .git is created in your current working directory (the folder you are viewing). This folder contains all the files and metadata used by the Git version control system.
git add - The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. It tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit.
git commit - The git commit command captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. Committed snapshots can be thought of as “safe” versions of a project—Git will never change them unless you explicitly ask it to.
